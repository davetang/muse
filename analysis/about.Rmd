* I'm a computational biologist that interested in software engineering, bioinformatics, mathematics, statistics, ...
* Many of the posts on this site are recreations and updates of posts on [my blog](https://davetang.org/muse/).
* Some posts only exist here; it's easier to work with the Docker/RStudio framework than WordPress
* If you need to contact me, please email me@davetang.org
